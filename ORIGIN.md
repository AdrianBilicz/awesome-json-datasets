## The Origin

> Alpha version `ORIGIN.md`

* When I was at MaxCDN, our Open Source efforts brought in 8% of referral traffic
* More traffic = more sales = more Open Source contributions we could make
* I always thought `README.md` was a great way to promote something relevant
* Kept seeing "[Awesome](https://awesome.re)" lists around
* I found myself Googling "json datasets" a lot for various reasons
* "Why not create an Awesome list for json datasets and link to MaxCDN at the top?"
* [So I did](https://github.com/jdorfman/awesome-json-datasets/commit/b5e57eb10f5fc27a8c58162f236c81a3f66eaf0c)
* I then sent it to all my nerd friends
* They weren't too enthusiastic
* My hopes of this hitting the front page of HN was not looking great
* Once I had some stars, I [submitted it](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome/pull/316) to Awesome
* Got more stars, but the referral traffic (to MaxCDN) was minimal
* If you look at the [license section](https://github.com/jdorfman/awesome-json-datasets#license) you will see "MaxCDN has waived all...", I left that in as a reminder of how much I will always love MaxCDN
* While the experiment failed, it inspired us to [start advertising](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6jiIeTwDKhs&feature=youtu.be&t=12m6s) in README's
